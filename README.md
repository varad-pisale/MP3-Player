# MP3-Player
 An Mp3 Player made by me using C++. Since C++ itself cannot play .mp3 files, I used Media Foundation to play the songs. It used OOPs concepts to provide security for files and avoids corrupting them.

-> How to Use
1. Save all your songs in respective Playlists and save all the Playlists together in a single folder. Example:- "My Songs".
2. Download the mp3_player.exe made by me and save it into the Parent folder. Example in the "My Songs" Folder.
3. Open the .exe and Enjoy your songs.

-> Note:- Save the name of files,folder in English only don't use any another language.
